### JAX-RS Demo

This is a quick demo I threw together to show off JAX-RS. Simply deploy it to your Tomcat server and goto alhost:8080/MyJAXRSApp/rest/sample to see JSON output.

This demo supports a simple query system, updating via put, creation via post, and deletion via delete. Hopefully this is educational as to the basics of JAX-RS
